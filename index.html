                Terrantula was intended as a serial set in contemporary America in order to explore ideas that weren't commonly understood,
                yet were of common concern.  However, as 2020 has continued on, it's become harder to understand how to write a contemporary
                story, especially one whose themes are now part of regular conversation between normal people.  If the world ever calms down,
                I'll try to figure out how Terrantula fits back into where we settle.  Until then, you can enjoy all both of the stories I

        <p class="describe">
          I'm an author of fantasy, sci-fi, and horror with the "and" playing an important role as elements of each show up in every story,
          be it Sam of Grayhaven's scientific approach to magic, Erebus' encounters with eldritch powers in the far future, or just general
          unsettling atmospheres and descriptions.  My education in computer science and math, as well as my hobby of gaming, also play into
          the way my stories are constructed and presented.
