          If you found one of my rune guides floating around, you've come to the right place!  Normally, I would have the website synced with a launch, but I saw someone had posted an older version of my Rune Primer to imgur with 100k views and I wanted to finish the newer version ASAP.  Likewise, an old version of the <a href="runes.html">Runes subsite</a> is up, but I don't know how functional it is.  I'll be working on it.

                Terrantula was intended as a serial set in contemporary America in order to explore ideas that weren't commonly understood,
                yet were of common concern.  However, as 2020 has continued on, it's become harder to understand how to write a contemporary
                story, especially one whose themes are now part of regular conversation between normal people.  If the world ever calms down,
                I'll try to figure out how Terrantula fits back into where we settle.  Until then, you can enjoy all both of the stories I 
                had so far:<br/><br/>
                After a strange trip to a conference, science reporter Michael Collins returned to South Carolina to find he'd changed.
                Can he put these changes to use for good, or does the world need Michael Collins more than it needs the Terrantula?

          I'm an author of fantasy, sci-fi, and horror with the "and" playing an important role as elements of each show up in every story,
          be it Sam of Grayhaven's scientific approach to magic, Erebus' encounters with eldritch powers in the far future, or just general
          unsettling atmospheres and descriptions.  My education in computer science and math, as well as my hobby of gaming, also play into
          the way my stories are constructed and presented.
